/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/shap/explainers/_kernel.py:708: UserWarning: Linear regression equation is singular, a least squares solutions is used instead.
To avoid this situation and get a regular matrix do one of the following:
1) turn up the number of samples,
2) turn up the L1 regularization with num_features(N) where N is less than the number of samples,
3) group features together to reduce the number of inputs that need to be explained.
